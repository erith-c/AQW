### Goal ###
The goal of the Aqua Project is to create a piece of software that is expandable beyond its initial scope, but works well and fits into existing utilities. 

Initially, its aim is to replace the Excel Template that is currently in use with a flexible piece of software capable of loading lists of pricing information for salesman to select, set a cost for, and then generate an Excel file that can be printed and edited as needed.
